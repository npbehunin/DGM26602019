Self Assessment

I have completed every project for this class and I believe I did them all to the best of my ability.

In the cohort groups, I actively tried participating and giving feedback on each of the student's work. Although I'm unsure whether or not my advice helped or contributed to the final projects, I feel I went out of my way to try to find things to talk to my classmates about.

I attended every class session. I even came to class on days when I was unaware we didn't have class (and to be honest I wish I had slept in).

I'm very happy with how my final animatic project turned out. I feel like I drew each frame well enough that other people will have an easy time understanding what is happening and how the story is playing out. Although I could have spent more time on the drawings themselves, the story and motion is clear enough that I'm happy with it.
